/*@brief  group_by_handler class*/
/***********************************************************
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * Provides server with group_by_handler API methods.
 * One should read comments in server/sql/group_by_handler.h
 * Attributes:
 * select - attribute contains all GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER items and calls it
 *              an extended SELECT list according to comments in
 *              server/sql/group_handler.cc.
 *              So the temporary table for
 *              select count(*) from b group by a having a > 3 order by a
 *              will have 4 columns not 1.
 *              However server ignores all NULLs used in
 *              GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER.
 * select_list_descr - contains Item description returned by Item->print()
 *              that is used in lookup for corresponding columns in
 *              extended SELECT list.
 * table_list - contains all tables involved. Must be CS tables only.
 * distinct - looks like a useless thing for now. Couldn't get it set by server.
 * where - where items.
 * group_by - group by ORDER items.
 * order_by - order by ORDER items.
 * having - having Item.
 * Methods:
 * init_scan - get plan and send it to ExeMgr. Get the execution result.
 * next_row - get a row back from sm.
 * end_scan - finish and clean the things up.
