# Bug 4543.  EM min/max was getting set for extent that wasn't scanned.  The extent was not scanned because another column's min/max
#	     value didn't qualify.

# Insert vals 1..10,000 from supplier.

# Run this select.  The dart_ad_id column will be the scan column as it's the first one in the table.
# The date_stamp filter will cause the extent to be skipped.

          group by date_stamp
          order by date_stamp;

# Validate that we see 10,000 rows with dart_ad_id >= 1.  Before the fix, this was returning 0 rows as the min was max and the max was min
# and the extent status was set to valid.
