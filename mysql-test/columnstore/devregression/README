1. General

The devregression test suite contains test cases migrated from development's regression tests.

2. Environment setup

Before execting this test suite, please execute regression_env_setup.test in the csinternal
directory.  This test will setup the required databases and tables for the test suite.

3. About the tests

These test cases are regression tests for fixed bugs in development's regression tests.
There are about 350 .sql files matching "bug*.sql" or "MCOL*.sql" patterns were identified.
Some of them failed to run in MTR due to required data was not setup, or syntax is not MTR
compatible.  There are also some cases that ran in MTR, but did not survive repeat MTR runs.
These failed test cases need more TLC before they can be migrated to MTR correctly.
