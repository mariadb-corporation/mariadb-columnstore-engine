## Checking out the source

Since MCS is not meant to be built independently outside outside of MariaDB server, we should checkout the [server](https://github.com/MariaDB/server) code first.

You can clone from github with

	git clone git@github.com:MariaDB/server.git

or if you are not a github user,

	git clone https://github.com/MariaDB/server.git

The MCS engine repo has a number of develop-X branches where X is a number and it equals with the last number of MariaDB server major release, e.g develop-6 must be used with 10.6 of the server. There is single exception, namely develop branch of the engine must be compile with a current develop version of the server.

	git checkout -b 10.6 origin/10.6

MariaDB server contains many git submodules that need to be checked out with,

	git submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1

This would be automatically done when you excute cmake, but consider we are focus MCS here, so dependencies of MCS should be installed first.

## Build Prerequisites

The list of Debian or RPM packages dependencies can be installed with:

	./install-deps.sh

## Building phase

After the dependencies had been installed, just follow the normal building instrutions to build, MCS will be compiled along with mariadbd.

But for development convenience, we supply a script to build and run Mariadb server in MCS repo.

- Remove all installed mariadb packages.

- Edit cs-docker-tools script:
```
MCS_SCRIPTS_REPO_PREFIX=/path/to/script/cs-docker-tools
MDB_SOURCE_PATH=/path/to/mdb_server
MDB_GIT_TAG=10.6
MCS_GIT_TAG=develop-6
```

for example for version 10.6.

- Running the script:
```
sudo bash -x /data/cs-docker-tools/shells/run_mcs focal Debug
```
where focal is distro name (affects artifacts placement layout) and Debug is CMake build type.
