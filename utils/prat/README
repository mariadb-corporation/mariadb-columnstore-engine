PRAT - Platform Run Analysis Tool


Overview
--------

The PRAT utility is a set of shell scripts designed to collect system activity
and performance data so that it can be made available to Calpont Customer Support.
Run under the supervision of Calpont support personnel, the utility will prompt the user
for the start and stop times of a period where the performance of an individual query or
the overall system is an issue.  PRAT will collect data from each of the hosts in a
particular Calpont installation and puts it into a format that can easily be 
transmitted to Calpont.

PRAT is installed with the Calpont InfiniDB application.  Automated processes that collect system activity 
(i.e. the "ps" command) are also installed with the Calpont InfiniDB application.  Finally,the PRAT utility 
relies upon the presence of the sysstat rpm package (see the Calpont InfiniDB Installation Guide).


Usage Instructions
------------------

To use the PRAT utility, the user must execute the main PRAT script from the Calpont
tools directory:

/usr/local/Calpont/tools/prat.sh

The user will then be prompted for the two digit day of the month of the time period in 
question.  The user will also be prompted for the start and end times of the time period
under study (in the format of "hh:mm").

Once the time frame data is provided, the user will then be asked for the root password for 
each host in the Calpont installation.

The utility will then collect all the pertinent data necessary to provide an analysis of
the overall system state and performance for the query or time period in question.  This
data is collected in the data directory under the tools directory in the form of tar files.
There is one tar file for each host in the installation and these files are then in turn
sent to Calpont support personnel for analysis.
