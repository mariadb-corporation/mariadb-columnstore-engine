/**
 * Columnstore interface for writing a User Defined Aggregate
 * Functions (UDAF) and User Defined Analytic Functions (UDAnF)
 * or a function that can act as either - UDA(n)F
 *
 * The basic steps are:
 *
 * 1. Create a the UDA(n)F function interface in some .h file.
 * 2. Create the UDF function implementation in some .cpp file
 * 3. Create the connector stub (MariaDB UDAF definition) for
 * this UDF function.
 * 4. build the dynamic library using all of the source.
 * 5  Put the library in $COLUMNSTORE_INSTALL/lib of
 * all modules
 * 6. restart the Columnstore system.
 * 7. notify mysqld about the new function:
 *
 *    CREATE AGGREGATE FUNCTION median returns REAL soname
 *    'libudf_mysql.so';
 *
 * The UDAF functions may run distributed in the Columnstore
 * engine. UDAnF do not run distributed.
 *
 * UDAF is User Defined Aggregate Function.
 * UDAnF is User Defined Analytic Function.
 * UDA(n)F is an acronym for a function that could be either. It
 * is also used to describe the interface that is used for
 * either.
