  NAME

	poll - select(2)-based poll() emulation function for BSD systems.

  SYNOPSIS
	#include "poll.h"

	struct pollfd
	{
	    int     fd;
	    short   events;
	    short   revents;
	}

	int poll (struct pollfd *pArray, unsigned long n_fds, int timeout)

  DESCRIPTION

	This file, and the accompanying "poll.c", implement the System V
	poll(2) system call for BSD systems (which typically do not provide
	poll()).  Poll() provides a method for multiplexing input and output
	on multiple open file descriptors; in traditional BSD systems, that
	capability is provided by select().  While the semantics of select()
	differ from those of poll(), poll() can be readily emulated in terms
	of select() -- which is how this function is implemented.
