# This file maps error ID's to error texts.
#
# When you need a new message text, you put it here and you add a detailed description
# in the error message descriptions document in the Software docs folder
#
# There must be three tokens on each line:
#
# token 1: error ID
# token 2: internal error name
# token 3: error message text to describe the error
# 
# The tokens should be separated by one tab character. The error message text may contain
# any character(s) except tab. The line must end with a single '\n'.

# Non support errors 1000 ~ 2000. 
# The query will go through the optimizer again with some optimization turned off
