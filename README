This is MariaDB ColumnStore 1.4
MariaDB ColumnStore 1.4 is the GA version of MariaDB ColumnStore. 
It is built by porting InfiniDB 4.6.7 on MariaDB and adding entirely 
new features not found anywhere else.

Additional features will be pushed in future releases. 
A few things to notice:
- Do not use pre-releases on production systems.
- The building of the ColumnStore engine needs a special build environment. We're working on making it available for everyone to build.
