This is MariaDB ColumnStore 1.0.10
MariaDB ColumnStore 1.0.10 is the development version of MariaDB ColumnStore. 
It is built by porting InfiniDB 4.6.7 on MariaDB 10.1.25 and adding entirely 
new features not found anywhere else.

MariaDB ColumnStore 1.0.10 is an GA release. This is the first MariaDB 
ColumnStore release, not all features planned for the MariaDB ColumnStore 1.0 
series are included in this release. 

Additional features will be pushed in future releases. 
A few things to notice:
- The building of the ColumnStore engine needs a special build environment. We're working on making it available for everyone to build.
